Unfortunatelly their website is down, but the images can also be found at Wikipedia.org (e.g. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Biceps-curl-1.gif)

The .xml files should all contain the license & author of the images.

Image format
============
Original images all were .gif or .png - that's bad when you have to change image size.
So I tried to convert them to .svg, and I think they now do look even better than before.
